# Cross Language ML with ISLR Labs


The motivation for this repository is to bring together some of the various techniques I have been exposed to in one place. 

I have decided to use a common data set in order to:

- have a consistent point of reference
- identify similarities
- highlight differences
- etc.

The data set and exercises come from [Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, and are further informed by their [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/user/dataschool/playlists?shelf_id=4&view=50&sort=dd). 

I found the [ISLR book](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf) to be a great learning tool and thought it an ideal candidate for this project. 

Unless stated otherwise I intend to add additional languages/tools to the table below.
